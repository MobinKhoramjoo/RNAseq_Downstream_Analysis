**RNA-Seq Downstrteam Analysis**
This repository contains a series of R scripts for RNA-Seq data analysis. The workflow includes key steps to process, visualize, and interpret RNA sequencing data.

Notebooks\
**PCA Plot:** Exploratory data analysis through Principal Component Analysis.\

**Differentially Expressed Genes Analysis:** Identification of differentially expressed genes across conditions.\

**Volcano Plot and FC vs. FC Plot:** Visualization of statistical significance, fold changes, and cross-condition comparisons.\

**Heatmap:** Visualization of gene expression patterns across samples or conditions.\

**Pathway Analysis:** Enrichment analysis to identify key biological pathways.\

**Deconvolution Analysis:** Estimation of cell-type proportions from bulk RNA-Seq data.
